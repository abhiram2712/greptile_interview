# AI-Powered Changelog Generator - Project Prompt

## Overview

Your task is to build an AI-powered changelog generator. 

**Examples of changelog websites:**

https://docs.stripe.com/changelog

https://www.twilio.com/en-us/changelog

Developers that maintain developer tools frequently have to write changelogs every few days updating end users (also developers). The end users typically see them on some type of public website. 

The challenge with writing changelogs is twofold:

1. You have to go through a few days of commits to make a list of everything that's changed
2. You have to summarize the changes that would be relevant to an end-user in a few bullet points. 

This is the type of job that would be perfect for an LLM!

## Submission

Your submission should have two parts:

1. A developer-facing tool that allows devs to quickly AI-generate a changelog.
2. A simple public-facing website where the changelog appears for people to see.

In your README, feel free to share why you made the technical and product decisions that you made!

Remember don't overcomplicate the solution and keep the design of the tool minimalistic and clean.
